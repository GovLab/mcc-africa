Our goal at The GovLab is to strengthen the ability of institutions — including but not limited to governments — and people to work more openly, collaboratively, effectively, and legitimately to make better decisions and solve public problems. We believe that increased availability and use of data, new ways to leverage the capacity, intelligence, and expertise of people in the problem-solving process, combined with new advances in technology and science, can transform governance. We approach each challenge and opportunity in an interdisciplinary, collaborative way, irrespective of the problem, sector, geography, and level of government.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Global Centre for Technology, Innovation, and Sustainable Development and The Governance Lab (The GovLab) at New York University Tandon School of Engineering are proud to announce their collaboration with five African cities to launch the 2020 Multi-City Challenge Africa public engagement initiative. </span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"Normal1\">The Multi-City Challenge combines extensive training for public servants to learn how to engage with residents (citizen engagement), with a competition to <strong>invite the public to share solutions (collective intelligence) and then a coaching programme for residents and public services to develop those solutions into implementable new policies and services</strong>. The initiative aims to tackle pressing urban challenges by partnering with the people most affected by these issues &ndash; city residents.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span>Residents in<strong> Accra (Ghana), Bahir Dar (Ethiopia), Kampala (Uganda), Kano (Nigeria), and Mutare (Zimbabwe)</strong> will be invited to develop solutions to three problems the cities are collectively confronting: digitalising the informal economy, building urban resilience, and improving waste management. Public servants will participate in an extensive training curriculum beginning this week focusing on problem definition to define the challenges precisely and with the benefit of data and citizen input. They will then launch an open innovation challenge toward the end of 2020 where city residents submit innovative ideas for how to best solve these priority issues.</p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p class=\"Normal1\"><span lang=\"EN\">The Multi-City Challenge Africa builds on successful implementation of the City and Multi-City Challenge model in Latin America, the US, and Europe. <strong>African city leaders will have the opportunity to work with other cities, pooling the expertise from their communities in this first-of-its-kind public engagement effort across cities.</strong> This initiative will also be advised by a group of experts on citizen engagement in Africa that will constitute the advisory board for the project.</span></p>\n</div>",

      "how_to_participate": "<h3><strong>PROGRAMME GOAL</strong></h3>\n<p>The Multi-City Challenge Africa aims to solve complex urban problems in collaboration with the people most affected by these problems: the residents of the city. The programme offers training to public officials of the participating cities to support them in defining challenges and solving them in collaboration with their residents. It offers the community a space to participate in the design and formulation of public policies and programmes at the local level, allowing them to provide their innovative ideas to overcome these challenges.</p>\n<h3><strong>THE CHALLENGES</strong></h3>\n<p>The participating cities, Accra, Bahir Dar, Kampala, Kano, and Mutare, have defined three shared challenges to solve together with their communities.&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://africa.multicitychallenge.org/topics/waste-management.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Reducing waste generation and improving waste management</a></strong> - Accra, Bahir Dar, and Kano.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://africa.multicitychallenge.org/topics/urban-resilience.html\"><strong>Building urban resilience in slums and informal settlements</strong></a> - Accra, Kampala, Kano, and Mutare.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://africa.multicitychallenge.org/topics/informal-economy.html\"><strong>Integrating the informal economy</strong></a> - Accra, Kampala, and Mutare.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>WHAT IS A GOOD IDEA?</strong></h3>\n<p>We seek innovative, low-cost ideas to solve these challenges that can be implemented by the cities in the short term. Solutions can include products, services, software, methods, models, public programme designs, and more. Solutions do not need to be novel. In fact, something that is in use elsewhere is of great interest but must be supported by evidence that the proposed solution will work in one of the participating cities.</p>\n<h3><strong>WHY PARTICIPATE</strong></h3>\n<p>Winners of the challenge will receive<span class=\"m_2794963995258900275apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">a</span><span class=\"m_2794963995258900275apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>recognition from New York University. Besides that, they will get the chance to<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;sit-down with UNDP, The Governance Lab, and the participating city councils to study how to implement their idea into a pilot that can be scaled!</span></p>\n<h3><strong>WHO CAN PARTICIPATE?</strong></h3>\n<p>Individuals or organisations interested in working to improve the urban context of the participating cities and, therefore, the quality of life of the residents, can participate regardless of their place of residence. However, we especially invite the residents of the five participating cities to submit ideas and to evaluate solutions proposed by others.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Individuals who are relatives of the members of the city teams (see members in the profile of each city) or of the Multi City Challenge team are excluded from participating in the challenge.&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><strong>HOW TO PARTICIPATE</strong></h3>\n<p>Participation is divided in two steps:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Step 1 (November 4th - Extended until December 23rd):</strong> Posting an idea to address one of the above three challenges in a city (maximum one idea per challenge per participant) to africa.multicitychallenge.org.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Step 2 (November 14th - December 23rd):</strong> Evaluating the ideas that you consider most 1) impactful, and 2) practical.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><strong>Step 1: HOW TO UPLOAD AN IDEA (November 4th - Extended until December 23rd)</strong></h3>\n<p>Go to <a href=\"https://africa.multicitychallenge.org/\">https://africa.multicitychallenge.org</a> and choose the challenge in which you wish to participate.
